    <p style="background-color: blue;">Vitamin D deficiency is a common health problem affecting many people worldwide. It occurs due to lack of
        exposure to sunlight or insufficient dietary intake. This vitamin plays an essential role in maintaining healthy
        bones and teeth, helping the body absorb calcium and phosphorus. It also strengthens the immune system.</p>

    <p>When a person has a vitamin D deficiency, they may experience symptoms such as persistent fatigue, muscle and
        joint pain, weak bones, and even depression. To prevent or treat this deficiency, it's important to get regular
        sun exposure, eat foods rich in vitamin D—such as fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified dairy products—or take
        supplements. </p>
